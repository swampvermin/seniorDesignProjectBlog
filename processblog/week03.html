			<h4 class="weekHeader">week 03 [ feb. 05, 24 ]</h4>

			this week i have done more research and started thinking realistically about the time constraits i'm under and what i should focus on for my project. i realized that i want to use mainly my own assets for the zine and use public doman images only when necessary. i think my best bet in order to have original assets would be to refocus my idea and instead shift to another thing i can photograph myself.<br><br>

			<br><br>
			at the time of me posting there is no way to book an appointment to print anything which is unfortunate but hopefully in the coming weeks the print lab opens up.
