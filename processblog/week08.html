			<h4 class="weekHeader">week 08 [ mar. 11, 24 ]</h4>

			<p>
				midterm week ! <br>
				final deliverable: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvL_4SvTBvkHMogBbLRtqVZZVwAZjlew/view?usp=share_link" class="linkText">link to my zine ⇥ </a> 
			</p>
			<p>
			i got into the actual design of my zine this week. i focused the first one on washington square park. i started off by experimenting with the risograph printer to get myself familiar with the work flow of preparing and printing files since i havent used it before on my own. 
			</p>

			<p>
			this was helpful in allowing me to guage what color combos i like best. i experiemnted mixing red, green, blue, pink, yellow, and black in many different ways. i found my favorite color combos are probably: <br>

			* blue + yellow +pink <br>
			* Blue red black <br>
			* Green black <br>
			* Yellow green blue <br><br>

			another thing this helped me realize is that printing is a long hard tedious process. i decided it would be best to limit myself only to 2-3 colors MAX just to save myself the headache. my currect fav color combos i want to use are: <br><br>

			* blue + yellow <br>
			* Blue + pink <br>
			* pink + yellow + blue  <br><br>

			this will probbaly change but for now its this
			</p> 

			<p>
				i then drew out a wire frame for my cover and pages.

			<p>
				i could not find free versions of the fonts i wanted to use so i ended up using Proxima Nova and Garamond. i decided to use the colors blue and yellow for my first zine. 
			</p>

			<p> 
				i then got started on the zine. the hardest part wasnt even the design part it was setting up the files for preview, it was a very very tredious process. i used the tools InDesign and Photoshop. here is a screenshot of all the images i had to work with :

			<p>
				i had to be very careful with my layers in InDesign because I will have to print each color layer individually. because of this, i had to create three seperate layer groups and track them carefully
			</p>

			<p>
				here is the end result of my first draft of zine 1. i still need to finish up like a spread and a half. i am pending an interview with a street vendor who often sells at washington square park, i sent them questions and im waiting on their reply.
